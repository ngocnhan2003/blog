* [IPython](http://ipython.org/index.html) - IPython is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers enhanced introspection, rich media, additional shell syntax, tab completion, and rich history.
* [GraphLab Create](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GraphLab-Create) - GraphLab Create is a Python library, backed by a C++ engine, for quickly building large-scale, high-performance data products.
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - Combined with the excellent IPython toolkit and other libraries, the environment for doing data analysis in Python excels in performance, productivity, and the ability to collaborate. *pandas* does not implement significant modeling functionality outside of linear and panel regression; for this, look to statsmodels and scikit-learn. More work is still needed to make Python a first class statistical modeling environment, but we are well on our way toward that goal.
* [PuLP](http://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/solvers.html) - Linear Programming.
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - matplotlib is a plotting library for NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.
* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Scikit-Learn is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis.  It is built on NumPy,SciPy, and mathplotlib. Scikit-Learn has the following features: Classification, Regression, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Model Selection, Preprocessing
* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.1/scala-programming-guide.html) - For distributed programming
